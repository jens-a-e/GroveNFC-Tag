# Grove NFC Tag iOS Reader

This repository contains code for exploring Speed Studio's configurable NFC tags
during the Open Hardware Training as part of [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.or€g.).

In order to find out if the NFC Tags from Seeed Studio could be read by an iOS device this project was created. The attempt has so far not been successful.

I had hoped to have a way to easily connect wearables made for participants to a companion app.

Unfortunately it turns out that the prototyping with NFC tags beyond a simple RFID card like feature not easily achievable. The documentation from Seeed Studio does not cover hints for my intended functionality. And the data sheet of the chip used on the Grove NFC Tag boards only documents a very low level register codes, for which I currently neither have the time budget nor the experience in implementing.

However, this is a start to add an app for iOS as Seeed Studio only links one for Android.
